      <p class="md:mt-2 mt-8">
        In 2012, Tony was lost. No, not physically lost. Tony was living in Boston, had just
        graduated college with a fancy engineering degree, but he was lost. It was
        around that time that he joined a free fitness group called November Project.
        Working out with that group, he discovered the power of transformation through a
        positive and supportive, fitness-based community. Ever since, he's dedicated
        part of his life to building and fostering, positive and supportive
        fitness-based communities.
      </p>
      <p class="md:mt-2 mt-8">
        In 2018, Tony was lost. Tony was living in San Francisco after moving there for work.
        He was a software developer working in the Tech industry getting paid a Tech
        salary, but he was lost. Finding himself on the other end of an identity
        shattering breakup, he went on a journey of self-discovery. There, he discovered
        the power of transformation within himself as well as his thirst for creative,
        meaningful work. He picked up a camera, waved goodbye to the cushy Tech job, and
        started building the skills and business you see here today.
      </p>
      <p class="md:mt-2 mt-8">
        Community, fitness, and transformation have been embedded in him and his work as
        a storyteller. He uses photos and films to tell the stories of communities that
        are building better spaces for genuine, transformative connection. He uses photos
        and films to tell the stories of individuals that are building better versions
        of themselves. He knows first hand the power of these and he's dedicated his
        work spreading these ideas to everyone through media.
