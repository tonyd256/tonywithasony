        I'm excited to introduce my Zine! I enjoy exploring ways to share my
        photos beyond Instagram and this is the latest experiment. I did an
        initial mailing to friends and family but the digital download will be
        available soon!

        If you received the physical copy, thank you again for reading.  The
        Zine idea came about after seeing a Zine made by IDEO on prototyping.
        There concept was that you could prototype anything. I agree and decided
        to make my own Zine. Looking at a printed photo is so much better than a
        small square on your phone. I thought of this Zine as an awesome
        alternative way for you to experience my photos. I hope you enjoyed it!
        I also thought to add musings in the form of a short written essay. The
        first version of this Zine had an essay on Scarcity vs Abundance mindset
        and how I'm trying to change my mindset to the latter. After reading and
        rewriting it a few times, it just didn't feel right. I decided to remove
        it completely and focus more on photos. As you have see though, I did
        try to add some thought provoking text in there, albeit lighter and less
        opinionated. I'd love to get your feedback and if you want to receive
        more physical art from me fill out this form:

        If you didn't get the physical Zine but want to get in on future things
        I create and send out, you can sign up for my membership community by
        clicking on this yellow button below. I honestly don't feel right asking
        for support when there are so many other things going on in the world so
        please see this as supplemental. Donate to some awesome nonprofits,
        charities, or relief efforts before you give anything to me. Monetary
        support here will go toward material costs of making physical art for
        you. All tiers are the same right now but I may add other benefits to
        higher tiers later on. If you have an idea for something you'd like to
        see me provide to members, let me know!
