title: Action Photography without all the Settings
teaser: You don't always have to use Manual mode. Shutter Priority Mode was made
  for this and it's the easier way to capture action photography.

I love using the manual mode of my camera. It can be challenging to adjust all
the settings in the moment but I enjoy that challenge and enjoy getting better
at it. Some days though, I don't want to put in so much effort. Using Shutter
Priority Mode allows me to let the camera help out.

When I'm taking photos of [November Project], like I've talked about in this
previous post, using Shutter Priority Mode allows me to simply lock in the
shutter speed at 1/500s or 1/400s and the camera will automatically keep the
Aperture as low as possible since the amount of light is still low. I can also
turn on Auto ISO. The Sony cameras allow you to select a range for Auto ISO too
which is very useful. In the summer, when the light is good, I'll keep the range
at ISO 100 to 400. In the winter, I'll use ISO 100 to 6400. If your camera
doesn't have the range ability with Auto ISO, you could simple use Auto ISO and
be fine. Remember, a grainy photo is better than no photo.

The Sony A7 iii camera is [ISO invariant] which means that the camera is adding
in artificial brightness after ISO 800. It is similar to how Lightroom adds
brightness. So the theory is that if your camera and Lightroom are both adding
brightness via some algorithm, your computer is going to be better at doing it
than your camera. So take photos at maximum ISO 800 and lighten them up in
Lightroom.

So far this has proven to be true but it still makes me nervous in the moment,
especially since I can't check my photos for composition while taking them or
even after since they're so dark. You can do some simple Google searching to see
if your camera is ISO invariant. For my Sony pals, it seems you're in luck with
the A7 iii and the A7R iii. Not so much with the [A6000] but perhaps with the
[A6300, A6400, and A6500].

Using Manual Mode can be fun but isn't always necessary. Shutter Priority Mode
can be a welcomed break for those days you'd rather focus on other things. This
is one myth that I hear about professional photographers. We don't always use
Manual Mode just because it's the professional thing to do. We use our cameras
as our tool like any artist would. Knowing and mastering all the capabilities of
our tools and when or how to use those capabilities is what makes us
professional.
