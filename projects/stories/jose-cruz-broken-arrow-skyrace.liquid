  José Cruz is a good friend in the Bay Area trail running community. He's
  funny, he's fast, and he's a talented musician. He has been known to many as
  Propeller Hat Man. This video was commissioned by Broken Arrow Skyrace.
  Broken Arrow is a trail race with a 52k, 26k, VK, 11k, and other distances
  put on at Palisades Tahoe every year. They livestream some of their races and
  during the livestreams they highlight awesome community members. This is a
  highlight video of José as he takes over and race directs his local Mt
  Madonna Challenge where proceeds go toward sending local kids to a running
  camp with Max King.
